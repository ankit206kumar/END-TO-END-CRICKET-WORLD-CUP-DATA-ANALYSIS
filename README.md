# END-TO-END-CRICKET-WORLD-CUP-DATA-ANALYSIS
**T20 Cricket World Cup Best Playing 11 Selection Project**

This project focuses on analyzing player performances from the T20 Cricket World Cup to identify and select the best possible playing 11 from all participating countries. The process integrates data cleaning, performance metrics analysis, and dashboard visualization to support decision-making.

Key aspects of the project include:

1. **Data Extraction and Cleaning (Python):** The raw dataset containing player statistics from the T20 World Cup is cleaned using Python. Data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, outlier detection, and data normalization are applied to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the performance metrics.

2. **Performance Analysis:** Advanced statistical analysis is conducted to evaluate each player's performance in various aspects, such as batting averages, strike rates, bowling economy, wickets taken, and fielding contributions. The analysis helps in ranking players based on their contributions to the tournament.

3. **Selection Criteria:** Specific calculation and weighted parameters are used to create a ranking system, considering various performance factors like consistency, match-winning abilities, and versatility (all-rounders). The project aims to form a balanced team of 11 players comprising the best batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, and wicketkeepers.

4. **Power BI Dashboard:** The cleaned and analyzed data is visualized using Power BI. The dashboard provides interactive and dynamic visualizations, allowing users to explore player statistics, compare performances, and visualize the top 11 players based on different filters like batting, bowling, or all-rounder skills.

5. **Team Composition Insights:** The dashboard also offers insights into the team composition, helping users understand the balance between batting and bowling strengths, as well as the overall flexibility of the selected playing 11.

This project provides a data-driven approach to forming the best possible playing 11 for the T20 World Cup by leveraging Python for data cleaning and Power BI for interactive visualization and analysis.
